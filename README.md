All the knowledge needed for this exercise can be found in this [simple tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvn-aFO--Q&ab_channel=DmitryKandalov)

### Java 11

This is one of the most widely used java versions.

### Gradle

I chose Gradle to build the project because is the main standard in the industry.
The configuration is writen in Kotlin to keep the same language as the model.
