## Technology choice

### Kotlin

My favourite programming language

### [Http4k](https://www.http4k.org/)

One of the main server [Kotlin side frameworks](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html#frameworks-for-server-side-development-with-kotlin)
All the knowledge needed for this exercise can be found in this [simple tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVvn-aFO--Q&ab_channel=DmitryKandalov)

### Gradle

I chose Gradle to build the project because is the main standard in the industry.
The configuration is writen in Kotlin to keep the same language as the model.
